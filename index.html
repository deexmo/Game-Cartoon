        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Dante and his twin brother, Vergil, were born to the legendary demon Sparda and the human Eva. 
            The family lived in a remote home near Red Grave City. 
            As young children, Sparda would train the boys and for much of Dante's early childhood, he didn't realize his father was a demon. 
            Sometime before their eighth birthday, Eva gave Dante and Vergil each one half of the Perfect Amulet. 
            Eventually, Sparda died under unknown circumstances, leaving Eva to care for the twins alone. Some time later, 
            they were attacked by demons. Eva was killed, and though both Vergil and Dante survived, the twins were separated, 
            and Dante believed Vergil to have died. Dante followed his mother's last wish and took up a new identity to hide from the demons, 
            adopting the name "Anthony 'Tony' Redgrave".</p>
            
        <p>Some years later, he found himself under the care of a woman posing as his mother on Morris Island. 
            He befriended a young boy named Ernest. Tony/Dante and his "mother" 
            were forced to leave when a demon attacked and burned down the town.</p>

        <p>Dante is a character and the main protagonist in the video game series Devil May Cry. 
            After returning to the Demon World, he along with his brother Vergil 
            are the current undisputed rulers of demon world.</p>
